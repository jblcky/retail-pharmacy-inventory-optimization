Starting my first project, still very beginner level. trying to learn while doing. This project aims to simulate and optimize the inventory levels of drugs in a retail pharmacy using demand forecasting and optimization techniques.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Generate synthetic weekly sales data for 100 SKUs
- Explore patterns using EDA
- Forecast weekly demand
- Build inventory reorder logic using EOQ & safety stock
- Evaluate cost-saving strategies

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
- `data/` – Datasets (CSV, cleaned, etc.)
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter/Colab notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `scripts/` – Python scripts for data processing & forecasting
- `models/` – Trained models or serialized outputs
- `reports/` – Charts, reports, and visual results

## 📦 Requirements
